for gui          - use tkinter
for tts          - use gTTS (Google TTS) at first
                 - mutagen to get tts file duration
                 - playsound3 to play the audio
                 - try using Piper TTS down the line (available at: https://github.com/rhasspy/piper)
                        * Piper allows for voice model training
for time         - use time




library ideas to look into:
        - we may need a mutithreading library to play sound while still allowing the user to type
        - spell check/grammar
        - SQL (for storing and analyzing user typing data)
        - sentence generator/dictionary?
